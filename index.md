## Backstory to the sports that I do
- I've been doing swimming my whole life. And right now I'm on the [Ned Baumer Swim Team](https://nedbaumerswimteam.wordpress.com) 
- I also started waterpolo because my dad wanted me to try it out because he did waterpolo. But I actually liked it, so everything turned out well. [Waterdog Polo](https://sites.google.com/view/waterdog-polo/home)
